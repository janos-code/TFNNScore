# TFNNScore
Keras implementation of NNScore described in "Soft Computing Tools for Virtual Drug Discovery" by Daniel M Hagan and Martin T Hagan

tfnnscoremod.py has a deep network (5 layers) and is just a version of tfnnscore.py I made to mess around with different architectures, hyper-parameters, etc. to see if I could improve the original model. Feel free to try your own network architecture by modifying the sequential model inside the fit_model function, see if you can improve accuracy.
